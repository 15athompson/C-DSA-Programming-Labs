Comparison of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort:

Algorithm steps (how it works):

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.
Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input array, removing one element each iteration, and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted array.

Time complexity:

Bubble Sort: Best case: O(n) - when the array is already sorted Average case: O(n^2) Worst case: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort: Best case: O(n) - when the array is already sorted Average case: O(n^2) Worst case: O(n^2)

Space complexity:

Bubble Sort: O(1) - only requires a constant amount of additional space
Insertion Sort: O(1) - only requires a constant amount of additional space

Stability:

Bubble Sort: Stable - maintains the relative order of equal elements
Insertion Sort: Stable - maintains the relative order of equal elements
In general, both algorithms have similar performance characteristics for small arrays. However, Insertion Sort tends to perform better than Bubble Sort for partially sorted arrays and is more efficient in practice. For larger arrays, more advanced sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort are preferred due to their better average and worst-case time complexities.
